Have you ever wanted to try out React? It's a great library to help you build UIs for your single page apps. Together we'll walk through the basics of this great tool, looking at its component abstraction, how it helps you manage state, and how it will simplify your approach to UI development. We'll give you a feel for what a real React project is like, touching on all the pieces you'll need to try it out yourself. In the end, you'll have a better idea for what React is good for and how you can pick it up to help you on your next project.
