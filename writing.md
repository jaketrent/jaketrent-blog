# Writing with the curse of knowledge

When you know more about a subject than your reader, there are pitfalls to writing well. One is the curse of knowledge. You may assume that others know exactly what you know and that they still need to learn certain things. This might be mismatched with their real needs.

In technical writing, you try to guide someone from the beginning to the end, with proficiency in some task as the goal. 

## Knowing where to start

Perhaps we don't start precisely at zero, assuming our reader knows nothing. But we start at some low-level starting point. But, where do you start? People start from different points of knowledge. And it's hard to hedge all your bets or give enough caveats.

To mitigte, prefer restating a few things at the risk of being obvious. People like a review. It's good to create the context and foundation for the more essential points you're about to make.

## Knowing where to end

Ending can be difficult, but should be less so. When you set out to write, the thing you're trying to accomplish should be well-understood by you. It's the reason you're writing after all.

To mitigate, precisely point out what you will be able to do by the end if you follow the steps to conclusion. And point out what you will not be able to do because of limitations. You might also point to continuing or alternate paths that you stop before pursuing in the present writing. You could point to assistive resources for continued learning.

## Knowing the resolution of steps

Like knowing where to start, it can be difficult to know how much hand holding through each step someone needs. It might be hard to know how specific to get on each step and how much to skip between each step.

To mitigate, make a judgement call between verbosity and terseness, focused on readability toward the end goal. Only favor adding detail when essential complexity seems to require it. Once you decide on a resolution, stick with it from beginning to end.

## Not leaving anything out

When there are lots of steps or related concepts, it can be easy to leave something out. Your reader will jump into the text and think, "Wow, where did that come from?" or "What does that mean? I've never heard of that before." Bringing things in out of order will have the same effect.

To mitigate, re-read and look for logical jumps where you may need to fill in steps or facts that are foundational to next steps.

And so in this curse of knowledge article, did I start in the wrong place?  Did I stop before I got to the point of usefulness? Did I leave stuff out? Definitely.
