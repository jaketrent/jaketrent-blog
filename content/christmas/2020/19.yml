phrase: So hat/er uns/erworben/coelorum gaudia
title: In Dulci Jubilo
artist: Mannheim Steamroller
performance: Synths by Synthgang
desc: German for "in quiet joy". This rendition is a bit more lively, perhaps the joy of a minstrel in a hall with merry makers rejoicing at Christmastime. I would like to be at such a celebration. The Saturday before Christmas is a good time for that.
