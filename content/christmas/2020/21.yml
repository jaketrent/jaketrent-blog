phrase: Hasten/now/good folk/of the village
title: Bring the Torch, Jeanette Isabella
artist: Jon Schmidt
performance: Piano by Synthgang
desc: Who is this Jeanette? Is she the only one with a light? Perhaps those calling think she simply needs to be there to see the Christ child and make up an excuse to engage her. Whether that or something else, I like the thought of her, being useful at the manger scene or at least being remembered by friends.
