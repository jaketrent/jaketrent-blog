phrase: So/to/honor/Him
title: Little Drummer Boy
artist: Mannheim Steamroller
performance: Synths by Synthgang
desc: Sometimes it feels like we don't have anything "good enough" to bring or to give. The important thing is to give. Frankly, that's what these songs are. They are praise to the Lord and cheer to our neighbors, family and friends. We honor Him. We give what we have. Our intent in the giving is what is most important.
