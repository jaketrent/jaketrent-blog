phrase: Yonder/breaks a new/and glorious/morn
title: O Holy Night
artist: Adolphe Adam
performance: Synths by Synthgang
desc: I learned recently that this song was played as a part of the first radio broadcast, followed by readings from the Bible. A new technology and a new reach and the most important message to send. Tomorrow is a new and glorious morn -- because He was born. He is the Light of the World.
