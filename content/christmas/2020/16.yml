phrase: Let/nothing/you/dismay
title: God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen
artist: Mannheim Steamroller
performance: Synths by Synthgang
desc: Apparently one of the first Christmas hymns sung in the streets of London when the other hymns of the day were still sung only in the church and only in Latin. Merry Christmas to all. There's also another version this that Mannheim does that I really love. Perhaps I can record this at an hour where I won't wake the children, and you'll get to hear it.
