phrase: Pour/honorer/le/Fils De Dieu
title: Carol of the Birds
artist: Bas-Quercy, arr. Mannheim Steamroller
performance: Synths by Synthgang
desc: I haven't learned the lyrics of this carol until now recording it. I've always like the calm, yet strong strumming and chorale-like haromny of this arrangement. The birds, in the peace of night, are off to see the Babe at Bethlehem.
