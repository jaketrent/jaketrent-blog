I picked this book up on recommendation, looking for a good old-fashioned scifi.  The recommendation was based on the fact that much of this story revolves around computers, or a computer.  It's a great book to revisit in the age of ultra-connectedness and talk of AI.  It's a bit of a thriller and a bit of a political commentary.  I came to find out later that it's also been held up as a bit of a revolutionary's handbook, given the revolution expertly fomented in the book.
