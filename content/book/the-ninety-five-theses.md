I did not realize until I read these, but every thesis seems a variation on the theme: Indulgances, forgiveness sold by the church, are wrong. Beyond wrong, they bring other ills upon the church and believers.

I agree with this premise. I believe that Jesus Christ sacrificed Himself to pay for the sins of all and that only our Heavenly Father can grant us the forgiveness that will free us of former sins.
