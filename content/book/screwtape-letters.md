I have loved everything by C.S. Lewis that I've read.  I've been a long time getting around to this one.  And since we read it over a couple family trips, I feel like I should probably read it again to be able to say I really experienced all of it.  It's hard to hear with moody kids in the car.

Anyway, C.S. Lewis obviously has well-honed insights on the nature of life, the temptations that man is given to, and the eternal forces that fight for and against us.  I recommend the book for anyone who wants their conscience pricked a bit, where you can see the less-savory tendencies of yourself exposed in his descriptions of temptations and how we all fall short of ignoring or learning from them.
