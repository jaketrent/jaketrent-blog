I read this with my kids. It was good for us to hear about a boy who had an easy life and then was struck with immediate hardship.  He learned that nothing in this new environment was easy. He had to learn new skills to survive. He had to be careful and grateful for what he had. He learned to appreciate all food and all material that helped support his life. This is a great reminder for those of us that live in abundance and take much for granted.
