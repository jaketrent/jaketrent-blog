The moral imagination is stirred by this tale. The daughter of a father who was unwilling to take accountability for his own folly agrees to sacrifice her life in his stead. She has courage in the face of the unknown. She finds happiness in a new, unexpected life. She is willing to recognize the good in someone whom does not fit a mold. She learns to look past appearances and see the goodness of a heart. She keeps her promises, even when afraid. She is a heroine worth reviewing.
