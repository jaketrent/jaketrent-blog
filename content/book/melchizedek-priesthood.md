I was very grateful for the book, a gift from a leader and friend.  It was an encouragement to do a good job and fulfill the expectations given to me as someone trusted by God.  I hoped to live up to that trust and still do.  This book gave a great doctrinal background for what the priesthood of God is, why it works, where it came from, and what it is to be used for.  In short, it's a commission to serve.  I love that.  In addition, the second half of the book is a list of principles by which the priesthood is usable.  These, when followed, are essentially attributes of Jesus Christ, whose priesthood it is.  They were very uplifting, inspiring, and aspirational.
