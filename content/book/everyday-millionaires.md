So much of what we're told about wealth and the wealthy is in the vein of: the wealthy are scumbags who cheated and lied for their wealth.  Or they were pampered and gifted it by spoiling parents.  In short, they don't deserve it.  They have been unworthy beneficiaries of a rigged system.

In his book, Hogan lays out the research and statistics for the everyday millionaries in this country.  There are more millionaires than ever.  Where did they come from?  How did they gain their wealth?  What are their habits?  What kind of people are they?  

The statistics, gathered from surveys of net worth millionaires across the United States, from every state, major city, rural to metro areas, and many backgrounds, paint a much different picture than the mainstream lambasting of the wealthy that you normally here.  

Here are some points worth remembering for me:

- Millionaires believe that they can be millionaires.  Then they work to get it done.  This requirements are available to all and required by all to realize the same outcome.
- 79% received no inheritance at all.  16% more than $100k.  3% over $1M.
- 48% from middle class parents. 27% lower middle class.  4.25% lower class.
- 79% of millionaires credit employer-sponsored retirement plans like 401ks as a major part of their ability to become a millionaire.

- 9 out of 10 have never taken out a business loan
- 80% have never borrowed money from friends
- Not a single respondent in 10k surveyed cited single stocks as a top 3 wealth-contributing factor.
- Most go to college, 88% with a bachelors.

- 80% exercise 3 times a week. 
- 70% are early risers
- 6% give monthly support to adult children.  71% never do.
- 8% have adult children living at home with them.
- 63% in first marriage, 75% married for 32 years on average.

Throughout the book he highlighted millionaires who made it to that status.  None had it handed to them.  They all worked with discipline and consistency.  They have impressive stories, and it takes impressive effort.  The opportunity is open to you and me.
