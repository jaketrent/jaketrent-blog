Bill Peet is one of my, if not the, favorite childrens picture book authors.  He is fantastic.  Energetic drawings, beautifully done.  Real, fantastic adventures.  

Anyway, his autobiography is another short treat.  It's the best-illustrated biography you'll have ever read.  

I got a little peek into his early life, which seems to be the topic of his books.  It tells of his eventual days at Disney.  It's fun to hear about those earlier times.

He's a giant of a story teller an illustrator in my experience.  I'm grateful for the great stories and images he's given me and my family.
