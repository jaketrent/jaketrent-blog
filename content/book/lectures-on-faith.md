This was something I had wanted to read for a long time and had started once before.  It's a series of lectures delivered by the prophet Joseph Smith to other leaders of the church at the time.  They revolve around the issue of faith, specifically faith in God.  The thing that struck me the most in this readthrough is how often Joseph is focusing on the supernal attributes of God that make Him worthy of one's faith and worship.  It does make sense, however little I've connected the two ideas in the past, that in order for one to believe fully enough in God to produce meaningful action in one's life, a full confidence in His ability to save and support is paramount.  

Anyway, it was short read, uplifting and instructive.  It's something I feel like I need to reread and study to glean additional insight.
