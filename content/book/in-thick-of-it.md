I appreciate the title of the book because I am in the middle of such an endeavor and the subject commands my attention.  


Here are a few thoughts from the book:

- Care about what God thinks, not what the Internet thinks.  He is the source of truth and our final judge.
- See yourself as a parent with a responsibility for a child's development, not just as another friend.
- Help your boys develop the best aspects of manhood in yourself and role model men around them.
- Discipline with love.  Boys need both.
- Teach honor of parents and adults, not just social niceties.
- Provide inspiration through messaging of truths, in opposition to the many untruths about themselves and life that boys receive daily.
- Parents of boys are in the thick of it, figuring it out, and need help from God.

Obviously these are good bits.  They are extracted from an already-short book.  But it could have been shorter.  The writing style isn't particularly engaging.  It would probably work better as a short sermon, which I imagine is Mr. Cruise's better strength.
