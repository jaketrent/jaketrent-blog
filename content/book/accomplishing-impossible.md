Life can seem like a lot to swallow sometimes.  Thankfully, we are not left without help.  God who put us here will personally help us.  And he has put within each of us the potential to rise to our challenges.

<!--more-->

President Nelson gives an encouraging collection of observations -- things that God helps us to do and things that we have the power to do -- to do what is asked of us.  We have the potential to create a life well-lived, influence others for good, leave our Earth improved, grow in our vast potential, and eventually return home to that God Who gave us life.  

We need words of encouragement in this life, and President Nelson gives many good ones here.
