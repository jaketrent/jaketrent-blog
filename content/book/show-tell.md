This is such a great distillation of formulas for talks to give.  The book is short and powerful.  

In it, learn the 3 truths:

1. Always tell the truth, it'll communicate heart to heart
2. Tell it with a story, it'll be unforgettable
3. Tell it with pictures, we'll communicate with clarity

Truth can be factual (data), appeal to emotion (heart) or the head (intellectual).

We remember that there are 3 buckets to fill in talk prep:

1. My idea: thoughts, impressions, data, anecdotes, ideas
2. My self: my goals, worries, hopes, insights
3. My audience: experiences, aspirations, demographics

We have to be clear on the truths of each aspect of teaching.  If we can fill the buckets, we can start seeing our idea and envision a story to tell it.

A good story will make sense of everything and bring the audience along.  There are 4 storylines:

1. The report: exchanging information, deliver facts
2. The explanation: show us how, increase ability or knowledge
3. The pitch: get us over a hurdle, change our actions
4. The drama: breaks our heart, then mends it, changing our beliefs

Each type of story addresses a different purpose for the talk.

Pictures are the best medium to tell a story.  And I love the case he makes for hand drawing.

Interestingly, our mind only works in 6 modes when learning and questioning, and these can be matched with types of drawings:

1. Who? What?: Portrait
2. How much?: Chart
3. Where?: Map
4. When?: Timeline
5. How?: Flowchart
6. Why? Equation

They usually also come in that order for our various storylines.

If I could put this into my mind, which is a great distillation of how to envision talks, I'd be able to better prepare and deliver talks.  This one's recommended for any speaker or teacher.
