I didn't realize that this book was designed to support a walking tour of monuments in Washington D.C.  Therefore, the book is a collection of stops at important buildings and memorials where the faith of America's founders and pivotal persons is displayed in quotes and other text hammered in stone.  It is inspiring to hear of their faith preserved in the monuments that help us as a nation remember our history and origins.  The book has other interesting filler around the history of the landmarks. But who designed it, how much it cost, and what the process for getting it completed were are less-interesting facts to me.  It's a short read, and it makes me want to go see the real locations.
