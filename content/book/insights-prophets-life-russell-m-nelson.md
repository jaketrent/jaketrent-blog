President Russell M. Nelson of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is simply magnificent. He is a disciple of Jesus Christ. He has cultivated a life that glorifies his master. He is a worthy servant who has developed much of the attributes of Christ. He is a great human example of these.

His life is compelling and interesting. The places he's been, the people he's been with and the experiences of his life were fantastic to read about.

I love the format of this book: It takes the highlights. It looks for insights. And there's a whole book of them! (And more.)  

This is the kind of book I could easily read again and recommend.
