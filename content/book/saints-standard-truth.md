This is volume 1 in a new history series of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  The commissioning of a new account of its history is significant, as it's only been done a few times ever and the last in the early 20th century.  Much has happened since then.  We'll eventually see that in later volumes.  This volume was a fantastic read.  It deals in the very beginning of the Church and in the life of its founder, Joseph Smith.  It is written in a very enjoyable and engaging narrative style.  My wife and I read the book, and both enjoyed it very much.  Even being very well-acquainted with the Church and its history, having been a member of it all my life, I still found much to learn, as different details, individual accounts, and stories were new to me and super interesting to learn.  I highly recommend this as a read to anyone interested in the origins of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
