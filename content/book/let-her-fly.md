Ziaddin seems like a great father.  He cares about his daughter.  He has seen clearly her worth.  I have read his words and seen the man talk.  He's full of love and admiration for his children.  That is fantastic.

The descriptions of his culture, the traditions of his father s through past generations are very different than what I experienced in my own family and observed in the families and generations around me.  Thank goodness for that.  I'm grateful that my grandmothers, my mother, and my sisters all receive veneration and respect in their individual family relationships and in the society that surrounds them.  Surely things are not perfect for them (or anyone else), but they don't have an expectation of it.  Their experience as respected women is so far and away different than what was described in this book, where women in Pakistan at this time were treated with much less respect.

They weren't mentioned in family genealogy.  They couldn't meet with visitors to the house.  They ate separately.  They were largely unseen in their communities.  Most went uneducated.  They were not celebrated as female babies to families.  They were scorned as a curse as female babies.  Many were seen as servants to do tasks instead of people with inherent worth.

This has been different in my observation in society I have kept in America, and thank God.  I am glad this is changing for women in Pakistan and similar locales, and thank God.  And thank you Ziaddin for positively changing the fate of your daughter and your family.
