My impression has been that ideas in this book are paramount.  They are of such important as to shape my life.  Of course, this isn't to be too surprising, since the main invitation of the book is to control our own lives -- make decisions according to the values that we espouse and then live purposefully according to those decisions.

Newport presents these ideas with great clarity and plain speech.  He presents descriptions of lives hijacked by the attention economy architects that I can readily associate with my own experience.  And thus, I can feel great desire to feel freer and more fulfilled outside of what largely feels like empty promises from Silicon Valley to evolve us into a more utopian future.  

The advice is practical, and I am taking much of it into my own practice.
