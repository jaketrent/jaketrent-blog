What a heart-warming book.  As said in the foreword, this book is full of comfort -- for those moms who thought their children must of been switched at birth and for daughters who thought that their moms never understood them.  For me, it was a heart-warming collection of stories that showed the real stuff of life, of family life.  We learn our greatest lessons in family life, and even though the book wasn't directly sharing lessons, I still left with the feeling of increased value in my own family.  

The stories were often laugh-out-loud funny.  She's a clever writer, and the family situations were easily-envisioned.  There is much to laugh about in a family that's committed to each other.  This family seemed to be.  Great read.
