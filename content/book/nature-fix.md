If we spend more time outdoors, we're happier and healthier.

<!--more-->

That's not a surprising concept to me or likely to anyone.  Nothing in the book is revolutionary around the thought. I guess the degree to which we are helped by nature or hindered by its lack in our lives was the most surprising thing.  

Our kids' development relies on it.

Our eyes rely on being outside, the sun helping us avoid myopia.

The images of trees, water and vistas relax, destress, and remove anxiety.

We are more apt as child and adults to channel creative energy outside as opposed to the stuffy indoors.

Noise pollution is everywhere on Earth. The more of it, the more stress and psychic weight. The more sleep interruption.

The bright sun acclimates our bodies to our sleep cycles.

Fresh air is good for our health.

Like I said, nothing too revolutionary here, at least what has stuck in my brain.  I fully endorse re-connecting with nature as a default environment that we ought to find ourselves in for our good. 

The thing I had a hard time with in the book was the narrative style.  Yes, it was engaging, kind of fun to read. But it was like I was reading her diary from all the research trips she went on in the book and she forgot to edit it down.  I just wanted to learn something about the value of nature to my wellness, not to relive the years of her life she spent researching.

Anyway, I'm grateful for the book.  I'm especially grateful for nature.
