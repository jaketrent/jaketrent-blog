When marketing ourselves, making a good impression will hinge on doing just a little more.

## Outrunning a Bear

It is said (by obviously sharp people) that to avoid getting mauled by a bear, we don't have to outrun it; we just have to be faster than the other slowest person.  It is also said that in order to avoid getting hacked, we just have to make it a little bit harder to hack us versus the next guy.

Marketing ourselves and thus making a good, useful impression is similar, I think.  You have to make a little more effort and be just a little better, and we will stand out and make an impression.

## Getting Noticed at Every Step

Let's say there's a position at a company that we'd like to work at doing a job we'd like to do, so we submit an application. From there starts a process that will have several important steps before we're hired into the job. The major steps are important, and we want to make an impression in each.

**Resume** If it's just a little better, sharper, clearer, more succinct, bolder, specific to the job, it's more likely to get noticed.  Take time and make a great, specific resume.

**Portfolio** If it's just a little easier to find, well-presented, obviously-updated, related to the job, filled-out, and given care, it's more likely to get noticed.  Take time and get it in shape and clearly linked to us and our resume before applying.

**Homework** If we take just a little more time, add a little polish, include our own flair, anticipate the next step, and create professional-level work in a homework assignment for a job interview, we're more likely to be seen as a serious contender. If we value the job opportunity, take the time to invest in it.

**Interview** If we are a little more enthusiastic, precise in our words, confident in our demeanor, clear in our thinking, and collaborative in the conversation, we're more likely to make a good impression.  Give the interview experience a bit of our extra energy and engagement.

## Make it an Easy Comparison

In doing just a little bit more, we're allowing our recruiter, hiring manager, or fan to press the easy button.  They will have an easier time making a comparison to the competition, and the impression we made will carry us when it counts.

Just do a little more.
