Here's quick summary of the meaning of color vocabulary.

<!--more-->

To say something is "the color" blue, for instance, is to over-simplify.  We can describe a bit more about color with a bit more vocabulary.

## Hue

Hue is the word that we really mean when most of us say "color".  Going around the color wheel, when we stop on a color, we're choosing the hue.  This is a point on the spectrum.

## Value

Adjustments to color within a hue are adjustments of value within that hue.  Value adjustments are identified as tints and shades.

## Tint

A color tint, or increasing the tint of a color, is adding white to the pure hue.

## Shade

A color shade, or increasing the shade of a color, is adding black to the pure hue.

## Tone

Tone is when we add gray to a color.  This lowers the saturation.

That's some useful colorful vocabulary, right?  How would you describe these concepts consiely?  What other terms do you find useful in this vein?
